            <h2> Welcome! </h2>
            
                <p> Thank you for stopping by to see the amazing duo! From first glance, you may think Ash and Olive are just the oridinary house cat.
                    That could not be further from the truth. They are evil, smelly, and for of RAGE. One must think if the risk is worth the reqard of attempting to pet them.</p>

            <h2> Gallery </h2>
                <p> Here is a collection of images of the fearless duo </p>
