            <h2> Ash: From Rags to Riches (and Riches to Rackets) </h2>

            <h3><i>Street Urchin:</i></h3>
                <p>Born and raised on the mean streets near the Amtrak station, Ash clawed his way through life alongside his five siblings,
                    battling for survival daily.  Basic necessities were a luxury, and every day was a fight.</p>
            <h3><i>Rescued and Reformed (or Not):</i></h3>
                <p>A stroke of luck changed his fate when he was adopted.  Comfort replaced hardship, but the newfound ease corrupted his soul.</p>

            <h3><i>The Purrfectly Evil Overlord:</i></h3>
                <p>Now, Ash spends his days terrorizing the local feline population and enslaving humans with his deceptively charming (yet objectively
                    ugly) Garfield-esque demeanor.  His life is a non-stop crime spree, fueled by an insatiable hunger for more.  He's no longer in it 
                    for the game; it's pure, unadulterated, devilish fun.</p>

            <h3><i>Financial Felonies & Fugitive Feline:</i></h3>
                <p>Despite his supposed responsibilities, Ash refuses to pay rent, claiming a lack of funds.  He's acquired money from some shady 
                    characters, who are now hot on his tail.  And to add insult to injury, he's never paid a single tax on any of his ill-gotten gains.
                    His life plays out to the backdrop of chill lofi beats, a soundtrack to his chaotic existence.</p>
